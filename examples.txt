\begin{enumerate}



\item A bowling ball is rolled down the alley with an initial velocity of $+ 10$ m/s. There is a small amount of friction, and it produces an acceleration of -0.2 m/s$^{2}$.



\begin{enumerate}

\item What is the velocity at 1 and 2 s?

\item What is the average velocity over the first 2 s?

\end{enumerate}



\item A ball is dropped from the roof of a 25-m-tall building. What is the velocity of the object when it touches the ground? Suppose that the ball is perfect golf ball and it bounces such that the velocity as it leaves the ground has the same magnitude but the opposite direction as the velocity with which it reached the ground. How high will the ball bounce? Now suppose, instead, that the ball bounces back to a height of 20 m. What was the velocity with which it left the ground?



\item A rock is thrown nearly straight upward from the edge of the top of a building at an initial speed of 22 m/s. Its trajectory will take it just past the edge, so that it lands on the ground. How much later must a second rock be dropped from rest at the same initial height of 10 m so that the two rocks hit the ground at the same time?





\end{enumerate}
